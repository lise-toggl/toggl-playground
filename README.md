These are some examples of what you can do with the Toggl API!

Each example is as self contained as possible for easy remixing.

Exports a CSV file containing the same data as the Toggl Projects page. Also exports clients without any associated projects.


## Weekly report

Produces a report in the same style as the Toggl weekly report email.
